## Project Aim

The primary goal of the "Finding Donors" project is to build a predictive model that can identify individuals who are most likely to make a donation to a charitable cause. This involves:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data about potential donors.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features that capture donor characteristics.
- **Model Building:** Developing and training machine learning models to predict donation likelihood.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance and making improvements.

## Techniques Used

This project utilizes several machine learning techniques to achieve its objectives:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most important features for the model.
- **Modeling:** Implementing various models such as:
  - **Logistic Regression:** For binary classification of donation likelihood.
  - **Random Forest:** To capture complex relationships in the data.
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** For high-dimensional classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- **Cross-Validation:** To ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
